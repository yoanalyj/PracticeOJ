A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int res[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            res[i][0] = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            res[0][j] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                res[i][j] = res[i-1][j] + res[i][j-1];
        return res[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
//经典方格子动态规划,求有多少种不同的方法./求最短路径(064题).
//转移方程参数也是最后要求的
